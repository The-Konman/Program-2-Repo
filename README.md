Program 2 - Konnor Lorance, George Vaporis, Madeline Griffin

Our idea for program 2 is to have a program that simulates having a stack of movies and being able to interact with the stack
as you would in real life. Using linked lists, we are going to make a dynamic stack to represent this. Driver.cpp will be
the "menu" part of the program prompting user interaction with the stack. Movie.h and Movie.cpp will be for our movie data.
LinkedList.h will be contain our dynamic stack and functions to interact with it. These functions will be able to print the
stack, print the current node(overloaded <<), add to stack, remove from it, sort it(ascending/descending), search for a value,
and other function that we haven't decided on yet. ListNode.h will be our other class that stores the current node. Its 
functions will be able to iterate to next node, set the value, and get the value.
